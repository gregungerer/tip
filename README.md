# tip

Tip is a really simple terminal program. Similar to the original uucp "cu".
It is purposely light weight and small.

It is very useful for connecting to devices over serial ports - modems,
serial consoles and similar. It supports all the usual serial port
configuration settings (baud rates, parity, stop bits, flow control, etc).
It also has the ability to capture session data to a file.

The code has been part of the uClinux-dist source package for more than
15 years. But it was never made available outside of that. This repository
is dedicated to just tip.
